# Typical School Path Generator for ÉTS students 

Welcome to the Typical School Path Generator for ÉTS students. This tool was created out of the need for a typical path guide that the school does not provide in PDF form. As an ÉTS student who secured an internship, I faced the challenge of not being able to present such a document and decided to take on the task of creating it myself.

Initially, I thought it would be a straightforward task, but it turned out to be quite challenging to produce clean, efficient, and robust code. Currently, the tool is tailored for software engineering students and may not cover all aspects. However, I plan to make updates in the future.

Enjoy using this tool, and stay tuned for future improvements!
